## Introduction
The project was done by the Amnesty International to map the experience of the Rohingya villagers in an effort to report the war crimes done by
the Myanmar's military.
First, a short background on the situation: according to news outlets, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched military operations against the Myanmar security force in one of Myanmar's state known as Rakhine State. The attack was a form of protest to voice issues faced by the Rohingya Muslim minority in the country. In order to retaliate, the security forces started a widespread campaign of violence against the entire Rohingya population in the region. In the following 10 months, they expelled more than 702,000 Rohingya people into the neighboring country Bangladesh. According to Amnesty International, the violence includes "widespread illegal detainment, torture, sexual violence, starvation and village burning." Almost all of the eleven crimes against humanity listed in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court were committed in that 10-month period.

The project combined evidences from maps, satellite images, photographs, drone footage, testimonial videos, and animations to deliver an unprecedented level of visibility and clarity into these crimes. The platform provides an interactive timeline of events to recount how Myanmarâ€™s military systematically destroyed Rohingya villages. In addition, the platform enables users to engage directly with the exhaustive documentation that Amnesty has gathered on the case as they move through the sequential animated timeline. The satellite imagery is especially important as it shows the before and after comparison in order to create a spatial narrative to show village burnings and infrastructure destructions. This reminds of one of the week 7 readings on "Affective Geovisualisations" about how one can use animations to evoke a certain emotion on the map viewer. The map authors did a really great job of utilizing modern techniques to get their point across.
